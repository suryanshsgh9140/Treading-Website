Introduction:
Brief Overview:
"I worked on a Full Stack Trading project that aimed to build a comprehensive crypto trading platform. The project included features like AI-based crypto query handling, secure transaction management, advanced wallet functionality, and robust user authentication, utilizing the latest technology stack."
Technical Details:
Frontend Development:

"On the frontend, I used React for building a dynamic user interface, combined with Tailwind CSS for styling and Redux for state management. I also integrated Axios for API calls and React-Router-Dom for routing. I was involved in implementing the user-friendly buy/sell interface, portfolio management tools, and the search functionality for cryptocurrencies."
Potential Questions:
"How did you manage state in your React application?"
"Can you explain how you implemented routing in your application?"
"What challenges did you face when integrating APIs on the frontend?"
Backend Development:

"For the backend, I utilized Spring Boot to create a robust RESTful API, with MySQL as the database for storing user and transaction data. I implemented Spring Security for authentication and used Java Mail Sender for features like password recovery."
Potential Questions:
"How did you ensure the security of user data in your application?"
"Can you explain how Spring Security was configured?"
"What strategies did you use to optimize database queries in MySQL?"
API Integration:

"I integrated several APIs such as Gemini API and CoinGecko API to fetch real-time market data and provide users with accurate information for trading decisions."
Potential Questions:
"How did you handle real-time data fetching from external APIs?"
"What considerations did you take into account when working with financial APIs?"
Payment Gateways:

"The platform supports transactions through Razorpay and Stripe for handling payments, ensuring smooth and secure financial operations."
Potential Questions:
"How did you manage the integration of multiple payment gateways?"
"What security measures did you implement for payment processing?"
Advanced Features:

"The platform also includes AI-based chat support, secure wallet transfers, transaction history tracking, and two-factor authentication to enhance security."
Potential Questions:
"How did you implement two-factor authentication?"
"Can you describe how the AI chatbot was integrated and what technologies were used?"
Challenges and Learning:
Highlight Key Challenges:
"One of the main challenges was ensuring data consistency and security across multiple components, particularly when dealing with financial transactions and user authentication."
Potential Questions:
"How did you troubleshoot and resolve issues during the development process?"
"What was the most challenging aspect of this project?"
Impact and Outcomes:
Conclude with Project Impact:
"This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with full-stack development, API integration, and implementing security best practices, which significantly enhanced my understanding of building scalable and secure applications."
Potential Questions:
"What did you learn from this project that you would apply to future projects?"
"How would you improve or scale this project if given more time?"
